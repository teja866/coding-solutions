## Problem

### Best Seat

You are given an array $A$ of $N$ distinct integers, where $A_i$ represents the number of the $i$-th available seat in a cinema hall.

The  **center position**  is defined as the average of the smallest and largest values in $A$. This position may not be an integer and may not correspond to an available seat.

Find the  **available seat closest to the center position**. If two seats are equally close, choose the one with the  **smaller seat number**.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $N$, the number of available seats.
- The second line contains $N$ distinct integers $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N$, in any order.
### Output Format

Print a single integer — the chosen seat number.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 1000$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$
- All seat numbers are distinct.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5
10 20 30 40 50
```

```
30
```

### Explanation:

The smallest and largest seat numbers are $10$ and $50$, so the center position is $(10+50)/2=30$.

Seat $30$ is available and lies exactly at the center.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
6
1 2 3 7 8 9
```

```
3
```

### Explanation:

The center position is $(1+9)/2=5$.

Seats $3$ and $7$ are both $2$ units away from the center. Choose seat $3$ because its number is smaller.

# cook your dish here
n=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))

a.sort()

if n%2==1:
    print(a[n//2])
else:
    mid=(a[n//2-1]+a[n//2])/2
    print(mid)
        
```
