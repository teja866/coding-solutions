## Problem

### Staircase Edits

An array $A$ is called a staircase if it satisfies the following condition:

- $A_i - A_{i - 1} = 1$ for all $2 \le i \le |A|$

You are given an array $A$ of $N$ integers, which you want to convert into a staircase array. In one operation, you can change the value of any one position in the array $A$ to any integer you want.

Find the minimum number of edits needed to transform the array $A$ into a staircase.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line contains one integer $N$. The second line contains $N$ integers - $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum edits to make the array $A$ a staircase.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^4$
- $2 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le N$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  The array is already a staircase.

 **Test Case 2:**  You can change $A_1$ and $A_2$ to get the array $[-1, 0, 1, 2]$.

for _ in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    a=list(map(int,input().split()))
    count=0
    for i in range(1,n):
        if (a[i]-a[i-1])!=1:
            count+=1 
    print(count)
```
