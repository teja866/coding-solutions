## Problem

### Longest Balanced Binary Substring

You are given a binary string $s$ of length $n$, consisting only of the characters `0` and `1`, and an integer $k$.

You may choose any  **substring**  of $s$ and flip at most $k$ characters in it. A flip changes $0$ to $1$ or $1$ to $0$. The chosen substring is called  **balanced**  if it contains an equal number of $0$ and $1$ after performing the flips.

Find the  **maximum possible length**  of a balanced substring. If no balanced substring can be formed, print $0$.

 **substring:**  A substring is a continuous part of a string. For example, if $s=\texttt{10110}$, then `011` is a substring of $s$, while `100` is not.

### Input Format
- The first line contains the binary string $s$.
- The second line contains an integer $k$ — the maximum number of allowed flips.
### Output Format

Print a single integer — the maximum possible length of a balanced substring after performing at most $k$ flips.

### Constraints
- $1 \le n \le 100$
- $0 \le k \le n$
- $s$ contains only 0 and 1.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
110001
1
```

```
6
```

### Explanation:

The entire string contains three `0`s and three `1`s, so it is already balanced. Therefore, the maximum possible length is $6$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
1111
2
```

```
4
```

### Explanation:

Flip any two characters from `1` to `0`. For example, the string can become: 0011
It contains two `0`s and two `1`s, so the entire string becomes balanced. Therefore, the maximum possible length is $4$.

def count(s):
    zero=0
    one=0
    for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i]=='1':
        one+=1
    else:
        zero+=1
    return zero,one
s=input().strip()
k=int(input())


if zero==one:
    print(len(string))
else:
    for i in range(k):
        if s[i]=='0':
            s[i]=='1'
        else:
            s[i]=='0'
        
        
```
