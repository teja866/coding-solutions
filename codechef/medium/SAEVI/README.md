## Problem

### Sum at Even Indices

You are given an array $A$ of $N$ integers and an integer $K$.

Consider only the elements present at  **even indices**  of the array, using  **0-based indexing**. Among these elements, consider only those whose value is  **strictly greater than $2K$**.

Find the sum of all such elements.

If no element satisfies the condition, print `0`.

### Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$ — the size of the array and the given number.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_0,A_1,\ldots,A_{N-1}$.

### Output Format

Print a single integer — the sum of all elements $A_i$ such that:

- $i$ is even, and
- $A_i > 2K$.
### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $-10^9 \le K \le 10^9$
- $-10^9 \le A_i \le 10^9$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
6 5
12 25 8 30 15 7
```

```
27
```

### Explanation:

The elements at even indices are:

- index 0 $\rightarrow$ 12
- index 2 $\rightarrow$ 8
- index 4 $\rightarrow$ 15

Since $2K=10$, the values greater than `10` are `12` and `15`.

Therefore, the required sum is:

$12+15=27$

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
5 10
15 30 20 50 18
```

```
0
```

### Explanation:

The elements at even indices are `15`, `20`, and `18`.

None of them is strictly greater than $2K=20$.

Therefore, the required sum is `0`.

n,k=map(int,input().split())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
sum1=0
for i in range(0,n,2):
    if a[i]>=2*k:
        sum1+=a[i]
print(sum1)
        
    
```
