## Problem

### Skip One Day

Chef has recorded his trading results for $N$ days in an array $A$. On day $i$, he earned $A_i$ coins. A negative value represents a loss.

Chef wonders what his total profit would have been if he had  **skipped exactly one day**. Skipping a day removes its profit or loss from the total; the results of all other days remain unchanged.

Find the  **maximum total profit**  he could have earned. The answer may be negative.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $T$ — the number of test cases.
- For each test case: The first line contains an integer $N$ — the number of days. The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum total profit after skipping exactly one day on a separate line.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $-100 \leq A_i \leq 100$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $10^6$.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
4
6 -4 2 -1
3
5 2 8
```

```
7
13
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1:**  Skip day $2$, avoiding the loss of $4$ coins. The total becomes $6+2-1=7$.

 **Test case 2:**  Skip day $2$, which has the smallest profit. The total becomes $5+8=13$. Chef must skip one day even though every day was profitable.

```py
# cook your dish here
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    a=list(map(int,input().split()))
    min1=min(a)
    sum1=0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i]==min1:
            continue
        else:
            sum1+=a[i]
    print(sum1)
```
